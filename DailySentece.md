Once in life, try something. Work  hard  at something. Try to change. Nothing bad can
happen.  -- Jack Ma

start  something you've  always wanted to do. 
Be  in control. 
Set long term goals and do small  actions 
every day toward them.

I can't change the direction of the wind,  but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.

The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.

Yesterday is history,  tomorrow is a mystery,  but today is a gift,  that is why  it's called present!

Keep your face always toward the sunsine,  and the shadows will fall behind you.

So let go of what others want you to be. 
Change,  is all of us. 
And the only person you are destined to become,  is the person you decide to be.


Some people hear their own inner voices with great clearness.  And they live by what they hear.  Such people become crazy,  or they become legends.

Don't deny all your efforts just because of a little problem. 
Don't feel useless just because of a little setback.

This path has been placed before you.  The choice is yours alone.

Face the past with the least lamentation, face present with the least waste and with the most dream to face future.

Your story may not have a happy beginning,  but that doesn't make you who you are.  It is rest of your story,  who you choose to be.

The optimist sees the opportunity in the disaster; the pessimist sees the disaster in the opportunity.

No matter when you start, the more importantly is that do not stop after started. No matter when you end, the more importantly is that do not regret after ended.

Success is the sum of small efforts,  repeated day in and day out.
