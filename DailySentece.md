Once in life, try something. Work  hard  at something. Try to change. Nothing bad can
happen.  -- Jack Ma

start  something you've  always wanted to do. 
Be  in control. 
Set long term goals and do small  actions 
every day toward them.

I can't change the direction of the wind,  but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.

The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.

Yesterday is history,  tomorrow is a mystery,  but today is a gift,  that is why  it's called present!

Keep your face always toward the sunsine,  and the shadows will fall behind you.

So let go of what others want you to be. 
Change,  is all of us. 
And the only person you are destined to become,  is the person you decide to be.


Some people hear their own inner voices with great clearness.  And they live by what they hear.  Such people become crazy,  or they become legends.

Don't deny all your efforts just because of a little problem. 
Don't feel useless just because of a little setback.

This path has been placed before you.  The choice is yours alone.

Face the past with the least lamentation, face present with the least waste and with the most dream to face future.

Your story may not have a happy beginning,  but that doesn't make you who you are.  It is rest of your story,  who you choose to be.

The optimist sees the opportunity in the disaster; the pessimist sees the disaster in the opportunity.

No matter when you start, the more importantly is that do not stop after started. No matter when you end, the more importantly is that do not regret after ended.

Success is the sum of small efforts,  repeated day in and day out.

Everyone has talent.  What is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark place where it leads.

Nobody can go back and start a new beginning,  but anyone can start now and make a new ending.

But why wait? Dream is now.

Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.

Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

Excellent is not a skill, it'a an attitude.

Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.

Put your heart, mind and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the sercet of success.

Change your thoughts and you change your world.

Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.

If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.

The secret of getting ahead is getting started.

Problems are not stop signs,  they are guidelines.

The only disability in life is a bad attitude.

Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.
